## IconButton Component

There is a custom IconButton component that you can use.<br/>You can define icons that are available in [DevIcons](https://devicon.dev). Here's one way you can use it:

```html
<IconButton text="Ionic" icon="ionic" href="https://ionicframework.com"/>
```

You can also use an image instead of an icon in the DevIcons catalogue. Just use `imageURL` instead of `icon` in the component.
